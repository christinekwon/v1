        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Non-fungible tokens, more commonly refered to by their acronym "NFT," are blockchain technology-based virtual assets that are utilized to trade digital art. Blockchains allow exchange to occur through peer-to-peer cashless currency by hashing and chaining
            sensitive text to produce auditable log files where sensitive information is not needlessly disclosed, but any member of a computer network can verify that the log is genuine and has not been tampered with. Cryptocurrrency's de-involvement
            of traditional banks allows NFTs to be freely traded between buyers and sellers without processing the transaction through a central authority or banks, which are traditionally placed as intermediaries to mitigate the risk of fraud (Park et
            al.)
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The first NFT entered the world with artist Kevin McCoy and developer Anil Dash's demo at Seven on Seven in May 2014 (Dash). The original motivation behind the NFT was a method to give digital artists control over how their work is collected and distributed,
            and provide them with a reliable mechanism make money off of it. In a world where art collectors were accustomed to purchasing physical artifacts, whether it be paintings, sculptures, or prints, and the presence of digital artists was growing
            rapidly, a marketplace that allows digital artists to make money with their work while ensuring authenticity and fair distribution seemed to be the next logical innovation.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Digital art, in this case, can encompass art that is created using a digital mediums, such as code and 2D and 3D graphic design software, as well as physical art that is converted into a digital form through processes such as scanning. Artists can place
            their artwork on the blockchain in a process called minting.

            lack of transparency
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            On Web3, business owners, artists, and investors can all operate under pseudonyms. In the traditional US market, this is not possible. Business executives of publicly traded companies have to utilize their real names to be named in Securities an Exchange
            Commission disclosures and reports. CEOs of private companies must use their real names due to banking regulations and "know your customer" laws that are created in part to prevent people with fraudulent history from doing business (Notopoulos)
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            This pseudonym movement goes against the current trend in the social media landscape where companies are trying to verify users' true identities, as seen in the likes of Facebook's real-name policy. Allowing people to work in anonymity can be liberating
            for people who are more susceptible to be harmed due to prejudice, as it creates a space where they can create with less judgment about the type of education they received, their gender, race, class and more. The alias movement is also helpful
            for those who simply do not wish to be public figures and go under the scrutiny of the world.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            However, what happens when the CEO of a crypto currency who operates under a pseudonym has a history of fraud, or is a problematic person in some other way? With pseudonyms, artists collectors have no way of obtaining information about the history and
            reliability of the leaders of the companies they are supporting. This problem was recently highlighted when the co-founder of DeFi protocol Wonderland was revealed to be a Michael Patryn, a convicted fraudster who previously co-founded QuadrigaCX
            exchange, a Canadian exchange that was operated as a Ponzi scheme and shut down while owing users around $190 million in cryptocurrency, and was responsible for several other crimes including computer fraud and bank and credit fraud (Pearson
            and Franceschi-Bicchierai). In exchange for giving people a space with less judgment and thus more freedom and opportunities for those who may otherwise face more limitations, users can be left in the dark about serious details they should
            consider such as criminal history and extreme political leanings.

            access
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            In thinking about inequality in the NFT world, it is important to ask the question, who has access to the space in the first place? Access in this context can be described in terms of the people who have access in the form of artists and collectors.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            In terms of artists, art is a discipline that has a difficult barrier to entry in the first place due to the limitations of society that fails to allow purely creating art as a viable career choice for most people, especially those with lower socioeconomic
            status and from marginalized communties. On top of that, digital art requires fluid access to technologies such as computers and softwares, and separate training to use such tools, which excludes people who are not in an environment where
            those are easily accessible. The ability to create digital art, especially as a career, is a great privilege.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Furthermore, there are not many opportunities for artists to learn about how the NFTs work and how to utilize them with safety and awareness. This issue is amplified due to the extremely new and rapidly-changing characteristics of web3. Learning an entirely
            new type of Internet, currency, and art marketplace needs to be done carefully with clear and accurate information, so that artists can sell their work and web3 engage with the space safely. Since this information is not something that can
            be taught through a school curriculum due to its fast-changing nature, artists who are interested in minting NFTs can pretty much only rely on Internet searches to acquire information. This, again, is only information that can be obtainted
            through ready access to the Internet, as well as proper knowledge on how to seek out reliable information.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            From the collectors side, it is helpful to consider the types of people who have enough money to invest in crypto in the first place. As web3 is still a relatively new and uncertain industry, and cryptocurrency is expensive to purchase, experimenting
            with this new technology is not an option for people who do not have a lot of extra money. Thus, crypto / NFT investors tend to be from higher socioeconomic classes. For this group of people, crypto is often a way to rest and grow their assets
            by purchasing art, making digital art something that is only obtainable by the wealthy. It is also important to note that over twice as many men as women invest in cryptocurrency (16% of men vs. 7% of women), and white people make up a majority
            (62%). of the cryptocurrency market (Cohen and Wronski). Personal investing is already discriminatory towards women and people of color due to the legacy of discriminatory systemic barriers, and the cryptocurrency market is reproducing many
            of the inequitable characteristics exhibited by the traditional investing world.

            artist exploitation
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Artist exploitation is a prevalent consequence of the NFT industry, and can be found in several forms including a difficult barrier to entry, idea appropriation, and brands taking over space created for artists.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Artists must pay to sell their work. Certain design features of the blockchain system create heavy limitations on the amount of transaction that can be carried out per second, and this amount is much lower than the amount of transactions that can be carried
            out by other, more traditional computer systems. Due to this costly and inefficient process, artists have to pay network usage fees to the platform in order to mint their NFTs. The network usage fees can range from a few dollars to hundreds
            of dollars. The more popular a platform is amongst collectors and artists, the more expensive the base cost is to put one's artwork on the blockchain. For artists, it makes sense for them to want to place their artwork on popular platforms
            so they can attract wider attention, but not every artists is able to afford the high costs of minting. This "pay to enter" system poses greater harm towards artists who are just beginning selling their digital art, and makes the space less
            accessible to smaller artists.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Which group do NFTs benefit the most? Most of the time, the original artist receives a large portion of the initial sale, but most of the money is generated in the NFT world through re-selling, as art pieces increase in value over time. NFT collectors
            often purchase pieces for investment purposes, so that when the artwork's value increases in the future, they can sell it to the next collector and pocket the profits. Instead of seeing value in the art itself, collectors often evaluate art
            by how the potential for its worth to increase in the future. Even in the traditional art world, art is often treated by rich buyers as investment pieces. Buyers purchase works not necessarily because they appreciate and resonate with the
            piece, but because they see its value increasing years down the line. The NFT space is a mere extension of this practice, and even expedites the process even more. By riding off of notions of exclusivity, virality, and scarcity, all fueled
            by Internet culture, pieces can skyrocket in value over the course of merely a few days, and become a vessel through which its collectors can make a large profit in a short amount of time. Ultimately, the group that makes the most money off
            of NFTs is the collectors. Here we can bring in the questions that are discussed in "Data Feminism" as a way to examine how power operates in the world of data science, and apply them to NFTs. Who benefits (and who is neglected or harmed)?
            Whose priorities get turned into products (and whose are overlooked)? (D’Ignazio and Klein). The people from dominant groups with privilege are often answers to these questions, which in the case of the NFT world are the wealthy investors.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            This system is extremely unfair to artists who only get paid when the artwork leaves their hands, and have no stake in the profits that are generated down the line when their pieces are handed off from investor to investor. The people who end up making
            the money are the collectors, while the artists are undercompensated and under-recognized. This system is reminiscent of the ghost work described by Gray and Suri, in the sense that the artists and the turkers are both given a false sense
            of agency and freedom where they feel that they have a lot more control over their work as well as opportunities for growth (Gray and Suri). However, in the bigger picture, their work and effort are being exploited to ultimately benefit to
            the greatest extent the people who are already extremely wealthy and powerful, such as the art collectors who already have a plethora money to invest, and the big corporations who generate enormous profits off of their work.

            exploitation continued... with BAYC and the meaning of art
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            It is already a well-known fact that appropriation and replication are one of the most pressing concerns with NFTs. People digitize well-known artists' artwork without their consent and profit off of their sales on the chain. The digital space also makes
            it easy for people to copy others' artworks and sell them (Jacobs). Multiple NFTs could be created all referring to copies of the same piece of digital art and each fraudulently claiming to be proof of the original (Mackenzie and Bērzina).
            However, here we focus on a related but slightly different issue where artists are underacknowledged and undercompensated by companies that profit off of their work.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Exploitation of artists by companies is demonstrated through the example of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, a collection of 10,000 NFTS that encompass variations on a cartoon ape character. The Bored Ape Yacht Club is brand, created by the company Yuga Labs
            that mass produce artwork to be sold in NFT marketplaces. One issue with BAYC is the fact that the founders, two people with literary backgrounds who had an interest in crypto and two engineers, have not compensated the original illustrator,
            a young Asian American artist named Seneca, enough in relation to the billions of dollars they have made off the project, and do not credit her contributon to the artworks when they are marketed sold (Hissong). </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Seneca's identity is lost in the branding of the BAYC collection. This problem is coupled with the fact that the people that run the billion-dollar company were unknown until February 2022, a year after it was founded, and after Yuga Labs had already
            made billions of dollars off of Seneca's artwork (Notopoulos). For over a year, the artist's work was unrecognized, and there were no people to hold accountable. Even after a few the founders were revealed, Seneca continues to be undercompensated
            for her illustrations while BAYC pieces rise in value each day, an upsetting phenonemon that perhaps illuminates more about the priorities of the participants in the NFT world than the company itself.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            Furthermore, there is discussion to be had about the way that brands and companies taking advantage of a marketplace originally created for independent artists. When people start companies to create art solely for the purpose of gaining a financial profit,
            what happens to the meaning of art? Furthermore, who can we call an artist? Art is now being created with the sole purpose of making money, as is the case with Yuga Labs and BAYC, rather being someone's artistic practice that serves as an
            exploration or expression of oneself. Art loses its meaning as a means for creative expression. An innovation that was originally supposed to open space up to artists has now become a playground for businesses to make money and disrupt the
            meaning of art.
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            In "Design Justice," Sasha Costanza-Chock emphasizes the importance of centering the voices of those who are most impacted by the product (Costanza-Chock). In the case of NFTs, the lived experiences of artist communities is the most crucial aspect to
            represent in the design process. As illuminated in the examples above, the system that is packaged as a way to support artists could actually put them in more danger and make them suffer greater losses. In order to create NFT-related technologies
            that are more user-centric, executives and developers must develop design processes that are based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks, and environments, are driven and refined by user-centered evaluation, and addresses the whole
            user experience. They should involves voices that would actually understand the experiences of real users throughout the design and development processes (“User-Centered Design Basics”). An approach to design that prioritizes the needs and
            concerns of people who are actually using the applications will yield the creation of more products that are safe and beneficial for artists.

            the design process of NFT platforms
        </div>

        <div class="paragraph">
            As Mike Monteiro emphasizes in "Ruined By Design," diversity of expertise in the teams that design technologies is extremely important. It is important to create an environment with as many different experiences, viewpoints, and ways of looking at the
            world and solving problems as possible, and this is applicable in the context of NFTs as well (Monteiro). The companies that develop platforms for NFT markets are primarily run by people interested in technology, finance, and interest, and
            fails to include artists in their leading teams, when they are designing tools for artists. Without getting the opinions and insights of people who actually engage with the practice of creating art, how will the technology developed listen
            to their needs?
