            In the summer following my sophomore year of college, I interned at Hancom Robotics, 
            which is tech a company based in Korea. Hancom develops multiple types of robots, 
            but the one I worked with most closely during my time was this one named "Toki". 
          </p>

            Toki is a child-sized robot that is used in households and schools to practice English with students through dialogues, quizzes, and storybook telling. 
            When practicing an English dialogue, Toki puts on these glasses and asks a question and displays it on the left lens, and waits for the student to respond while displaying the correct answer on the right lens, like so. 
          </p>  
          <img class="square-image" src="../resources/images/tokitalk/dialogue.jpg">
          <p>  
            Something special about Toki is that not only does it come with an English curriculum that consists of dialogues student can practice, 
            but it also allows teachers to create their own additional dialogues and quizzes and send them to the server. 
            This is where my work comes in. Here is a sample Excel spreadsheet a teacher could create.
          </p>
          <img class="wide-image" src="../resources/images/tokitalk/format.png" class="web">
          <p>
            I created a Spring Web MVC Project that provides an interface for teachers to upload the Excel files they create. 
            This was my first time working with Spring, and at first it appeared very daunting, but I was thankfully able to catch on pretty quickly. 
            One thing to keep in mind: I did not bother too much with styling the website at this stage because I was focused on solidifying the backend functionalities first. 
            Anyway, this is what the main page looks like.
          </p>
          <img class="wide-image" src="../resources/images/tokitalk/landing.png" class="web">
          <p>
            Once the teacher clicks "upload," they are taken to the follow page, where each cell is a text field pre-filled with the respective spreadsheet contents.
            My team members originally just wanted the server to process and save the contents of each cell to a database table, but I suggested that we add some extra measures for security. 
          </p>
          <img class="wide-image" src="../resources/images/tokitalk/edit.png" class="web">
          <p>
            First, all the required categories are indicated by an asterisk, and the user is unable to submit if any of the cells in a required category is empty.
          </p>
          <img class="wide-image" src="../resources/images/tokitalk/requirements1.png" class="web">
          <img class="wide-image" src="../resources/images/tokitalk/requirements2.png" class="web">
          <p>
            Fields that must be numbers, such as the book number and book unit, require an integer input. 
            Additionally, for fields that requires a very specific String format, like audio file names, 
            I placed some regular expressions to make sure the input strings are valid. 
          </p>
          <img class="wide-image" src="../resources/images/tokitalk/requirements3.png" class="web">
          <img class="wide-image" src="../resources/images/tokitalk/requirements4.png" class="web">
          <p>
            After this thorough process, the teacher can finally submit and see all the contents they have submitted so far. 
            I utilized MySQL for the database.
          </p>
          <img class="wide-image" src="../resources/images/tokitalk/done.png" class="web">
          <p>
            As was displayed in the landing page, there are three additional buttons below the the file upload section. 
            The first, called "show dialogues," simply shows everything that is stored in the database so far. 
            The second, called "edit dialgoues," displays everything from the database as a form and allows the user to edit the contents.
          </p>
          <img class="wide-image" src="../resources/images/tokitalk/edit.png" class="web">
          <p>
            The third, called "clear dialogues," empties the database. 
          </p>
