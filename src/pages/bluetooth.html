              Say hello to Toki!

              Toki is an educational robot developed by Hancom Robotics, where I interned the summer after my sophomore year. 
              It teaches English to pre-school and elementary school students through verbal dialogue exchanges and quizzes. 
              It is used at home for daily conversation practice, as well as in schools and English academies.
              <br><br><br>
              A frustrating problem that we encountered when testing Toki at various academies was that in classroom environments where there were numerous students conversing with each other at once, 
              Toki often had a difficult time discerning the voice of the student that it was speaking with. 
              After much contemplation and discussion, we eventually decided to implement the functionality to 
              connect a bluetooth headset with Toki so that students can speak into a microphone. 
              This would allow Toki to pick up the individual student's voice better, and the student would also be able to hear Toki more clearly when there is a lot of background noise. 
              <br><br><br>
              I utilized Android Studio to develop an application for the robot that has the following features:
              <br><br>
              1. Turn bluetooth functionality on and off
              <br>
              2. Make Toki discoverable to nearby bluetooth devices
              <br>
              3. Display all nearby bluetooth headsets
              <br>
              4. Display all paired devices
              <br>
              5. Allow the user to pair and connect to nearby devices
              <br>
              6. Allow the user to connect to already paired devices
              <br>
              7. Disconnect with devices
              <br>
              8. Unpair with devices
              <br><br><br>
              I was unable to take a photo of the final product, but here are some progress shots of me first testing the functionality on a phone, and then trying it on the robot itself!
